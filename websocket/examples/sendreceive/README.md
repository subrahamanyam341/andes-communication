## WebSocket Client-Server Example

This example demonstrates a simple client-server interaction using WebSocket communication. 
The setup includes a client folder and a server folder, each containing a respective binary.
The server binary starts a WebSocket server and sends a message, while the client binary 
starts a WebSocket client and waits to receive a message.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the client folder.
3. Built and run the client
``` bash
    go build && ./client
```

> One can run multiple instances of the `client` binary.



4. Open another terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the server folder.
6. Build and run the server
``` bash
    go build && ./server
```
7. Wait for the server to successfully send the messages and the clients to receive them.
8. Close the clients and the server.
