## Sections

### WebSocket communication

The web socket functionality allows real-time bidirectional communication between a client and a server. 
It provides a persistent connection that enables instant data transmission and updates.

#### Examples
The [examples](./websocket/examples) folder contains a demonstration of how to send and receive messages using the WebSocket host implemented in this repository. 
This example provides a basic usage scenario to help you understand and get started with the WebSocket functionality.

### P2P communication

The peer-to-peer communication is managed by the `Messenger` implementation, which handles both messages broadcasted through the entire network and messages sent from directly connected peers.
